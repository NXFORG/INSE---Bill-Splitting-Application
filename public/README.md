# Public Folder

We store all of our HTML, CSS and extras within the public folder. This folder is then served by the node.js server when the server is run.

For organisational purposes, the Javascript, JSON and Images all have their own folder to make them easy to locate and easy to keep track of.

Code Information
-----------------

We have tried to keep our code in the highest quality possible. All of the variables which we use have appropriate names making them easy to identify. We have used functions where applicable to avoid duplicate code. All of our code is also commented to ensure high levels of readibility.

The program is written in Javascript however, to make the code easier to write and easier to understand for people reading it. We have decided to use the Javascript JQuery library. This makes all our code shorter and easier to understand.
